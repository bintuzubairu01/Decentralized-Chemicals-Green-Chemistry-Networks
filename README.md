# Decentralized Green Chemistry Network

A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for managing green chemistry research, processes, and market development using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The Decentralized Green Chemistry Network consists of five interconnected smart contracts that facilitate:

- Research organization verification and management
- Process optimization tracking and results
- Environmental impact assessment and scoring
- Safety evaluation and approval workflows
- Market development and product transactions

## Smart Contracts

### 1. Research Organization Verification (`research-org-verification.clar`)

Manages the registration and verification of green chemistry research organizations.

**Key Features:**
- Organization registration with specialization details
- Verification system for credible organizations
- Public verification status checking

**Main Functions:**

- `verify-organization`: Verify an organization (owner only)
- `get-organization`: Retrieve organization details
- `is-verified`: Check verification status

### 2. Process Optimization (`process-optimization.clar`)

Tracks green chemistry process optimization submissions and their results.

**Key Features:**
- Process submission with optimization targets
- Results tracking for efficiency and waste reduction
- Status management throughout the optimization lifecycle

**Main Functions:**
- `submit-process`: Submit a new optimization process
- `update-process-results`: Update process with results
- `get-process`: Retrieve process details
- `get-process-status`: Check process status

### 3. Environmental Impact (`environmental-impact.clar`)

Measures and evaluates the environmental impact of green chemistry processes.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive environmental metrics tracking
- Automated environmental scoring system
- Verification workflow for assessments

**Main Functions:**
- `submit-assessment`: Submit environmental impact assessment
- `verify-assessment`: Verify assessment (owner only)
- `get-assessment`: Retrieve assessment details
- `calculate-environmental-score`: Calculate environmental performance score

### 4. Safety Assessment (`safety-assessment.clar`)

Conducts and manages safety evaluations for green chemistry processes.

**Key Features:**
- Hazard level and exposure risk assessment
- Safety procedure documentation
- Approval workflow for safety compliance

**Main Functions:**
- `submit-safety-assessment`: Submit safety evaluation
- `approve-safety-assessment`: Approve safety assessment (owner only)
- `get-safety-assessment`: Retrieve safety details
- `is-process-safe`: Check if process meets safety standards

### 5. Market Development (`market-development.clar`)

Facilitates market connections and transactions for green chemistry products.

**Key Features:**
- Product listing with sustainability metrics
- Transaction processing and tracking
- Green certification support

**Main Functions:**
- `create-listing`: Create a product listing
- `purchase-product`: Purchase from a listing
- `get-listing`: Retrieve listing details
- `update-listing-status`: Manage listing availability

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain development environment
- Clarity CLI tools
- Node.js and npm for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd green-chemistry-network
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to the Stacks blockchain using the Stacks CLI:

\`\`\`bash
stx deploy_contract research-org-verification contracts/research-org-verification.clar
stx deploy_contract process-optimization contracts/process-optimization.clar
stx deploy_contract environmental-impact contracts/environmental-impact.clar
stx deploy_contract safety-assessment contracts/safety-assessment.clar
stx deploy_contract market-development contracts/market-development.clar
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Register a Research Organization

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .research-org-verification register-organization
"Green Chemistry Lab"
"contact@greenlab.org"
"Sustainable catalysis and green solvents")
\`\`\`

### Submit Process Optimization

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .process-optimization submit-process
u1
"Catalyst Optimization"
"Improving catalyst efficiency for reduced waste"
"50% waste reduction")
\`\`\`

### Create Market Listing

\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .market-development create-listing
u1
